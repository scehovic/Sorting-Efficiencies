# Sorting-Efficiencies
Tests Efficiencies of different sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Insertion Sort.

This was a project for a class, we were provided some method names and descriptions of what methods should do. We had to come up with our own solution, this is all my own code. 

The folder "listsUsedForParameters" includes all the testing files we were provided. It includes new "alphabets" which is just a way of redifing what letters/symbols come in 
what order. The folder "sortedLists" includes what the output files are once the program has successfully sorted the word list ranging from some being ten words longall the 
way to others being a million words long.
